# House Price Prediction

## Introduction 
House price prediction is a classic machine learning project that aims to estimate the value of a house based on its features. These features can include location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, year of built, and various other attributes. This project demonstrates the application of several machine learning models to analyze and predict house prices with reasonable accuracy. Accurate house price prediction is valuable for both buyers and sellers, as well as for real estate market analysis.

##  Data Preprocessing 
- Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. It involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing the data to make it suitable for training models.

## Features 
The dataset contains several features that influence house prices, including:
- **Location**: The geographical area of the house.
- **Size**: Square footage or number of bedrooms/bathrooms.
- **Age of Property**: The year the house was built.
- **bedrooms**: No.of available bedrooms in the house.
- **Water Availability**: No.of resources for availability of water
- **Other Attributes**: Additional factors such as  floors, etc.

## Graphs & Visualizations
- **Bar Plot**: A bar plot is used to visualize the grade's of prices based on the house price.
- **Predicted vs Actual Prices**: A Scatter plot and Bar plot used to compare predicted and actual prices.

## Conclusion
This project explores various machine learning models for house price prediction, analyzing their performance using error metrics and visualizations. 
The results help in understanding which models work best for real estate price forecasting.
